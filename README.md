# AES_PEP

## GitHub Pages

This project is deployed as a static site. The entry point is `index.html`, which is a copy of `aes_pep.html` for GitHub Pages compatibility.

### Publish

1. Push the repository to GitHub.
2. In **Settings → Pages**, set **Source** to **Deploy from a branch**.
3. Choose the `main` (or `master`) branch and `/root` folder, then save.
4. GitHub Pages will serve the site from `index.html`.

To update the site, edit `aes_pep.html` and copy the changes into `index.html`.
